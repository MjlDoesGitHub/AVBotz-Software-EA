Part One: 
Our current modeling system is based on Monte Carlo Localization (MCL). Write a brief description on how MCL works. Your response should be less than a page. 

The Monte Carlo Localization is a type of algorithm that is programmed to navigate the robot through its environment.
Basically, there are randomly generated particles/points in an area of some sort. 
Then, the robot senses and responds to its environment by determining their movement using its own sensors. 
The robot weighs the particles using probability of where it will navigate. After the robot makes a move, every different particle will randomly generate.
The robot keeps on generating guesses until it finds the ones that are most consistent and valid.
